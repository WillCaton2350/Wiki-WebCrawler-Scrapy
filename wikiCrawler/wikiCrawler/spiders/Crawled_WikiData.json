The original contents of the , , especially the pre-Sargonic part, were probably significantly altered only after the Ur III period, as a reaction to the societal upheaval that resulted from the disintegration of the Ur III state at the end of the third millennium BC.

Thus, it would make sense to present the predecessors to the Akkadian kings as a long, unbroken line of rulers from Kish. In this way the Akkadian dynasty could legitimize its claims to power over Babylonia by arguing that, from the earliest times onwards, there had always been a single city where kingship was exercised.,  Later rulers then used the ,  for their own political purposes, amending and adding to the text as they saw fit. This is why, for example, the version recorded on the Weld-Blundell prism ends with the Isin dynasty, suggesting that it was now their turn to rule over Mesopotamia as the rightful inheritors of the Ur III legacy.,  The use of the ,  as political propaganda may also explain why some versions, including the older , , did not contain the antediluvian part of the list. In its original form, the list started with the hegemony of Kish. Some city-states may have been uncomfortable with the preeminent position of Kish.

Various approaches have been offered to reconcile these long reigns with a historical time line in which reigns would fall within reasonable human bounds, and with what is known from the archaeological record as well as other textual sources. ,  argued in his major 1939 study of the ,  that, in principle, all rulers mentioned in the list should be considered historical because their names were taken from older lists that were kept for administrative purposes and could therefore be considered reliable. His solution to the reigns considered too long, then, was to argue that \"[t]heir occurrence in our material must be ascribed to a tendency known also among other peoples of antiquity to form very exaggerated ideas of the length of human life in the earliest times of which they were conscious.\" In order to create a fixed chronology where individual kings could be absolutely dated, Jacobsen replaced time spans considered too long with average reigns of 20–30 years. For example, Etana ruled for 1500 years according to the , , but instead Jacobsen assumed a reign of circa 30 years. In this manner, and by working backwards from reigns whose dates could be independently established by other means, Jacobsen was able to fit all pre-Sargonic kings in a chronology consistent with the dates that were at that time (1939) accepted for the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia.,  Jacobsen has been criticised for putting too much faith in the reliability of the king list, for making wishful reconstructions and readings of incomplete parts of the list, for ignoring inconsistencies between the ,  and other textual evidence, and for ignoring the fact that only very few of the pre-Sargonic rulers have been attested in contemporaneous (i.e. Early Dynastic) inscriptions., \n",

Rowton, for example, observed that a majority of the reigns in the Gutian dynasty were 5, 6, or 7 years in length. In the ,  system used at that time, \"about 6 years\" would be the same as \"about 10 years\" in a ,  system (i.e. a general round number). This was sufficient evidence for him to conclude that at least these figures were completely artificial.,  The longer time spans from the first part of the list could also be argued to be artificial: various reigns were multiples of 60 (e.g. ,  reigned for 600 years, ,  ruled for 840 years) while others were ,  (e.g. ,  reigned for 900 years (square of 30) while ,  ruled for 324 years (square of 18))., \n",

For example, many recent handbooks on the archaeology and history of ancient Mesopotamia all acknowledge the problematic nature of the ,  and warn that the list's use as a historical document for that period is severely limited up to the point that it should not be used at all.,  It has been argued, for example, that the omission of certain cities in the list which were known to have been important at the time, such as ,  and , , was deliberate.,  Furthermore, the fact that the ,  adheres to a strict sequential ordering of kingships which were considered equal means that it does no justice at all to the actual complexities of Mesopotamian political history where different reigns overlapped, or where different rulers or cities were not equally powerful.,  Recent studies on the ,  even go so far as to discredit the composition as a valuable historical source on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia altogether. Important arguments to dismiss the ,  as a reliable and valuable source are its nature as a political, ideological text, its long redactional history, and the fact that out of the many pre-Sargonic kings listed, only seven have been attested in contemporary Early Dynastic inscriptions.,  The final volume on the history and philology of third millennium BC Mesopotamia of the , -funded ARCANE-project (Associated Regional Chronologies for the Ancient Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean), for example, did not list any of the pre-Sargonic rulers from the ,  in its chronological tables unless their existence was corroborated by Early Dynastic inscriptions., \n", 
    "Reliability_of_Source_5": "Thus, in the absence of independent sources from the Early Dynastic period itself, the pre-Sargonic part of the ,  must be considered fictional. Many of the rulers in the pre-Sargonic part (i.e. prior to Sargon of Akkad) of the list must therefore be considered as purely fictional or mythological characters to which reigns of hundreds of years were assigned. However, there is a small group of pre-Sargonic rulers in the ,  whose names have been attested in Early Dynastic inscriptions.This group consists of seven rulers: , , , , , , , , , , ,  and , .,  It has also been shown that several kings did not rule sequentially as described by the , , but rather contemporaneously.,  Starting with the Akkadian rulers, but especially for the Ur III and Isin dynasties, the ,  becomes much more reliable.,  Not only are most of the kings attested in other contemporaneous documents, but the reigns attributed to them in the ,  are more or less in line with what can be established from those other sources. This is probably due to the fact that the compilers of the ,  could rely on lists of year names, which came in regular use during the Akkadian period. Other sources may have included votive and victory inscriptions., \n", 
    "Reliability_of_Source_6": "However, while the ,  has little value for the study on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, it continues to be an important document for the study on the Sargonic to Old Babylonian periods. The ,  offers scholars a window into how Old Babylonian kings and scribes viewed their own history, how they perceived the concept of kingship, and how they could have used it to further their own goals. For example, it has been noted that the king list is unique among Sumerian compositions in there being no divine intervention in the process of dynastic change.,  Also, the style and contents of the ,  certainly influenced later compositions such as the , , the , , later king lists such as the , , and the ,  by , ., \n",

The two stories share the flood as the major event however, although the hero who survives in Eridu Genesis is called Zi-ud-sura instead of Artahasis. Eridu Genesis was recorded around the same time as Atra-Hasis, however the fragmented tablet that held it was found in , , located in modern-day east , , while the version of Atra-hasis that came from the same time was found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in modern-day north Iraq., \n",

However, one day Adapa was knocked into the sea by the south wind, and in a rage he broke the south wind’s wings so that it could no longer blow. Adapa was summoned to be judged by , , and before he left Enki warned him not to eat or drink anything offered to him.

When they get to be too numerous, loud, or otherwise bothersome, the gods attempt to control the population through plagues, droughts, and most famously, the great flood. This disregard for human life emphasizes the hierarchy that existed in the Mesopotamian consciousness, with humans existing as subjects to the will of the gods.\n",

These versions were written in different languages, including Akkadian, , , and Old Babylonian, and were often translated from one to another, leading to further inconsistencies due to the inherently imperfect nature of these translations., \n"
